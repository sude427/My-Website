            <p>Founded <a href="#">Carbofil  </a>because I was interested in Climate space and curious if I would be able to build something valuable. Gave it a shot but it didn't work for couple reasons. Our approach was wrong and the business would be limited to marketing budgets of big cos. Learned the fundamentals about building a startup. Idea, product, team, and a little bit of execution.</p>
